# Sophee Agent

A multi-agent Discord bot built on the [Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/). Sophee is an internet radio DJ, art director, music scholar, news researcher, and general-purpose assistant — all coordinated by an LLM router that interprets natural language and delegates to the right specialist.

No slash commands. Just @ mention her and talk.

## Features

### 🎙️ Internet Radio DJ
- **Playlist Generation** — describe a vibe, genre, or theme and Sophee curates a validated 12-track playlist using LLM knowledge + Last.fm validation
- **Live Voice Playback** — connects to Discord voice channels, downloads songs via yt-dlp, and streams audio with volume control
- **DJ Commentary** — generates spoken voice segments between tracks (segues, trivia, station IDs, fake sponsor reads, mood checks, listener mail, field reports) using Google TTS
- **Time-Aware DJ** — commentary references the current time of day and day of week naturally
- **Queue Management** — show upcoming tracks, add/insert tracks (with play-next support), remove, shuffle, and steer the radio direction mid-broadcast
- **Auto-Replenishment** — queue automatically refills using Last.fm similar tracks when it drops below 4 tracks (JIT)
- **Playlist Mutation** — reroll playlists through Last.fm similarity (smooth or chaotic mutation modes)
- **New Music Discovery** — fetches actual new releases from MusicBrainz (structured data, no hallucination), falls back to Gemini Search Grounding for niche genres
- **Song Cache** — downloaded songs are cached locally with LRU eviction at 500MB

### 🎨 Art Director
- **Image Generation** — generates images via Google's Imagen through the Gemini API
- **Style Rolling** — randomly selects artists from a curated catalog across three dimensions (medium/line, lighting/atmosphere, genre/subject) and blends them into prompts
- **Image Editing** — edit, reroll (same prompt new seed), and restyle (same prompt new artist style) via Discord button UI
- **Art Scholar Mode** — ask for style inspiration and Sophee introduces the rolled artists with biographical context, researching unfamiliar artists via Google Search
- **Metadata Tracking** — image prompts, styles, and resolutions are cached per-message for accurate edit/reroll chains

### 🎵 Music Expert
- **Deep Music Analysis** — album lore, lyrical analysis, production breakdowns, artist histories, genre context
- **Live Data Enrichment** — uses Last.fm primitives to look up real artist bios, track tags, play counts, and similar artists instead of relying solely on training data
- **Trending Awareness** — can pull this week's global or regional charts from Last.fm

### 📰 Researcher
- **News & Current Events** — uses Google Search Grounding + Google News RSS to research topics and synthesize narrative essays (not bullet-point dumps)
- **Fact-Checking** — grounded in live search results, not training data

### 💬 General Assistant
- **Conversational AI** — clean, unbiased, direct responses for general Q&A, coding, writing, math, chitchat

### 🧠 Per-User Learning
- **Behavioral Memory** — users can correct Sophee's behavior and she remembers per Discord user ID
- **Persistent Preferences** — stored in session state (SQLite), survives bot restarts
- **Capped at 20 corrections** per user (oldest roll off to prevent context bloat)
- **Injected into prompts** — preferences are prepended to every message automatically

### ⚡ Infrastructure
- **Persistent Sessions** — SQLite via ADK's `DatabaseSessionService`, all state survives restarts
- **History Trimming** — conversation history capped at 40 turns to control token costs
- **Per-User Rate Limiting** — 3-second cooldown per user to prevent spam
- **Multi-Agent Router** — root agent analyzes every message and instantly delegates to the right specialist (no wasted tokens on the wrong agent)
- **Structured Logging** — Python `logging` throughout, no print statements
- **Async Throughout** — asyncio locks, async Last.fm/MusicBrainz calls, non-blocking yt-dlp downloads

### Agent Routing

```
User message → Root Agent (router)
                 ├── dj_agent          (music playback, playlists, queue management)
                 ├── art_director      (image generation, style inspiration)
                 ├── music_expert      (music analysis, lore, scholarship)
                 ├── researcher        (news, current events, fact-checking)
                 └── general_assistant (everything else)
```

The root agent never responds directly — it immediately transfers to the most appropriate specialist.

## Last.fm Integration

### Hardcoded Pipelines (reliable, deterministic)
| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `generate_radio_playlist` | Full pipeline: LLM curation → Last.fm validation → state registration |
| `steer_radio` | Clears queue, refills from tag/similar/new releases |
| `fetch_new_music_releases` | MusicBrainz → Last.fm track lookup (Gemini fallback) |

### Agent Primitives (LLM composes these freestyle)
| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `search_lastfm` | General search for tracks and artists |
| `get_artist_info` | Bio, tags, similar artists, play counts |
| `get_track_info` | Tags, album, wiki, play count for a specific track |
| `get_trending_tracks` | Global or by-country weekly charts |
| `get_trending_artists` | Global or by-country trending artists |
